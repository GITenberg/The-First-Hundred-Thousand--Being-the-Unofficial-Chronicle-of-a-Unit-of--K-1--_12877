description: This 1916 novel, based on the author's combat experiences, tells the
  story of Kitchener's volunteer army from its mustering in 1914 to its first great
  blooding in the 1915 Battle of Loos, where, at the cost of 20,000 British casualties,
  not one inch of ground was gained. Hay's tone perfectly captures the strong character
  of the soldiers and commanders in times of great difficulty.
